|---|---------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Ticket Creation (30%) | Ticket creation works in all cases, and the tickets collect all information that is relevant to its ticket category as found in the category mappings document. All tickets succesfully insert into the database, and feedback is given to the user that his has happened. | Ticket creation works for all tickets. Tickets generally follow the category mappings, and the input methods for those mappings makes sense. All tickets insert into the database, but feedback is not given or is minimal. | Ticket creation is present, but does not work in all cases. Tickets do not collect all necesary information, as layed out in the category mappings document. Most tickets insert into the database, but some do not. | There is no system for creating tickets |
| Individual Tickets (15%) | Users are able to view, edit and resolve tickets they create. The system is simple to use and works in all cases | Users are able to view, edit, and resolve tickets they create. The system does not work in all cases, or is confusing to work with. | Users are able to view tickets they created, but not edit or resolve them. | There is no system for viewing, editing, or resolving individual tickets |
| Branch Tickets (15%) | Users can see all tickets for all branches. Tickets can be filtered by branch, and there is a way to view an individual branch ticket. Seeded HR tickets are not visible. | The system for handling branch tickets is in place, and works in most cases. All tickets for a users branch are displayed, but the system does not adequately handle things like filtering by branch, or viewing individual branch tickets. Seeded HR tickets are not visible. | The system for handling branch tickets is in place, but it is very simple. Users cannot sort by branch, tickets are not displayed correctly, and there is no way to view individual branch tickets. HR tickets are not seeded to DB, or are visible. | There is no system to handle branch tickets |
| Web Styling (20%) | The system has many consistent elements, and draws influence in its style directly from the EPL homepage. The system is easy for users to handle, allowing for intuitive use with little instruction. If instruction is necessary, it is found on the website itself. | The system has many consistent elements, and draws some influence from the EPL brand.

Style choices lead to confusion, or a poor experience from users.  | The system does not follow a consistent style, does not draw from the EPL brand, and makes the user experience confusing and unpleasant. |
| Code Quality (15%) | Building of the project is clearly documented in the README (ideally one-step build). The code is well-organized, has a consistent style throughout the project and uses an automated style checker (eg. eslint). Functions are reasonably sized (under 100 lines). Route names are consistent (ideally RESTful) and objects are documented. | Building project is missing 1 or 2 details. Reading through the code is easy, some functions maybe too long or inconsistently named, commented out code is not present. | Building project is documented but missing 3+ details. Code is difficult to understand, helper functions are rarely used when needed, there is very little documentation that does not help understand the code, commented out code is present but limited. | No build documentation. Code is difficult to understand, functions are too large or all in one file, route names are very inconsistent, there is no documentation, and commented out code is present |
| Additional Features (5%) (must be documented in README as **Extra Features** | An Additional Feature is present and contributes to the overall value of the project. This is things like a mobile version, an information section, or confirmation emails being sent to users on ticket creation | An Additional Feature is present, but has some glitches or is fairly simple. | There is an attempt at an additional features | No additional features are present |
