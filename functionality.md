Functionality Marking Rubric
==========================
|  | Proficient (4) | Acceptable (3) | Needs Improvement (1) | Unacceptable (0) |
|---|---------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Overall Application Quality (40%) | The system can be used to create and view tickets of different categories. Tickets information matches the category mappings document. After being created, tickets can be found in a database that uses the schemas provided by EPL. The application is bug free.| Tickets generally follow the category mappings. The application has few bugs | The application has many bugs or noticeable oddities. Tickets do not match the category mappings document. The database does not use the schemas provided by EPL | There is no system for creating tickets |
 Feature implementation (25%) | All key features are implemented and work as expected. | Most key features are implemented, but the application is lacking | The bare essentials are not implemented | Only out of scope features were implemented |
| UI and UX (20%) | The system has consistent elements and draws influence in its style directly from the EPL homepage. The system is easy to use and provides helpful guidance. Feedback is provided when appropriate. | Style is inconsistent in places and could match EPL's branding better. The application does not adequately explain the ticket creation process | Style is inconsistent and does not match the EPL brand. The application is cumbersome to use and does not provide any guidence in the ticket creation process  | The system does not follow a consistent style, does not draw from the EPL brand, and makes the user experience confusing and unpleasant. |
| Code Quality (15%) | Building of the project is clearly documented in the README (ideally one-step build). The code is well-organized, has a consistent style throughout the project and uses an automated style checker. Functions are reasonably sized (under 100 lines). Route names are consistent (ideally RESTful) and objects are documented. | Building project is missing 1 or 2 details. Reading through the code is easy, some functions maybe too long or inconsistently named, commented out code is not present. | Building project is documented but missing 3+ details. Code is difficult to understand, helper functions are rarely used when needed, there is very little documentation that does not help understand the code, commented out code is present but limited. | No build documentation. Code is difficult to understand, functions are too large or all in one file, route names are very inconsistent, there is no documentation, and commented out code is present |
| Additional Features (Bonus 10%) (must be documented in README as **Extra Features** | Additional Features are present and contribute to the overall value of the project. These include features such as a mobile version, an information section, or confirmation emails being sent to users on ticket creation | An Additional Feature is present | There is an attempt at an additional feature | No additional features are present |
